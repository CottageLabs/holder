Hello Laura see the below list of colleges and their campuses.
Please put the college name into google (and the campus if there is more than one and needs differentiating).
Google should show a panel on the right with the campus address and post code.
If not immediately shown by google, go onto the college web site and find the post code.
Write the post code after the college and campus name on the same line (you can see some below I have already done)

Then go to this web address and put the outcode in lowercase on the end (outcode is the first part of a post code, before the space)
https://gateway.cottagelabs.com/postcode/outcode/

So here is an example I have already done for Forth Valley - the address becomes:
https://gateway.cottagelabs.com/postcode/outcode/fk10

The result includes a lat and lon field - write the latlon values separated by a comma on the line next to the relevant college.
So you can see the Forth Valley example line I have already done below, it shows 56.115,-3.781 after the post code.

NOTE: to make the result pages easier to read, use google chrome and install the jsonview browser extension:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc

Then do the same for the full post code, all lowercase and with no blank spaces, at the following address:
https://gateway.cottagelabs.com/postcode/postcode/

So for the Forth Valley example it becomes:
https://gateway.cottagelabs.com/postcode/postcode/fk101px

And again the result set includes lat and lon fields, this time the values are to a higher degree of precision
Copy and paste them, as before, onto the line, separated by a comma. See the Forth Valley example below, 

The two URL addresses above will ask you for a username and password - when you get time to do this, call me and I will tell them to you.
